# Order Service Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Order Service is a core component of the trading ecosystem, supporting both bot-based and manual order management across centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges. This document outlines the implementation plan and JIRA tasks for developing the Order Service.

## Architecture Summary

The Order Service follows a layered architecture:

1. **API Layer**: `OrderController` acts as the entry point, handling HTTP requests and delegating to the business logic layer.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: `OrderService` orchestrates the order lifecycle, bot operations, and strategy execution.
3. **Validation Layer**: `OrderValidator` ensures data integrity by validating orders, bots, and strategy parameters.
4. **State Management**: `OrderStateMachine` manages order state transitions.
5. **Data Access Layer**: `OrderRepository` handles persistence and caching via PostgreSQL and Redis.
6. **Exchange Integration**: `ExchangeAdapter` interface with implementations like `DexAdapter` for interacting with exchanges.
7. **External Dependencies**: Integration with services like `WalletService`, `MarketDataService`, and event emission via Kafka.

## Data Models

- **Bot**: Represents a trading bot with attributes like `botId`, `traderId`, `strategy`, and `settings`.
- **Order**: Represents a trade order with attributes like `orderId`, `botId`, `status`, `type`, and trade parameters.
- **Execution**: Represents the execution of a strategy with attributes like `executionId`, `botId`, and `details`.
